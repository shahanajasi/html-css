    <p><strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong>(<i>HTML</i>) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a <em >web browser</em>. It defines the content and structure of web content. <i>HTML</i> elements, which are a series of instructions, tell the browser how to display content, such as headings, paragraphs, and links. For example, <i>HTML</i> can structure content into <u>lists, paragraphs, images, and data tables </u> .<i>HTML</i> is often used in conjunction with other technologies, such as <big>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</big> and scripting languages like <small> JavaScript</small>. For example, JavaScript can be used to add dynamic functionality to <i>HTML</i>, which is primarily used for static websites. 
        <i>HTML</i> can also be used <tt >outside </tt> of the <insert >internet </insert> , such as in <mark >intranets</mark> and internal applications.<del>Back-end</del>engineers may need to understand <i>HTML</i> structure to ensure everything runs smoothly, even if other languages in their tech stack generate <i>HTML</i> for them. Marketers may also use <i>HTML</i> for blogs and emails.
